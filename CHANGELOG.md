## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0]

The first public release.

### Added

- History: every commit of HEAD and its upstream (or all refs, `r`), with refs, ahead/behind
  marks, a commit detail header, and a file list (flat or a directory tree, `t`).
- Diffs: syntax highlighting (tree-sitter, with a syntect fallback), changed-word emphasis,
  unified or split view (`s`, automatic on wide terminals), line wrap (`W`), expandable context,
  and whitespace modes (`w`). Added and deleted files always use the full width.
- Changes: live status from the file system, staging by file, hunk or line (Space, gutter clicks
  and drags), discard with a copy in the Trash, and a commit box with amend, co-authors and undo.
- Network: fetch, pull (fast-forward, merge or rebase) and push with progress and cancel,
  credential and passphrase prompts inside the app, and a background fetch every few minutes.
- Search (`/`: text, author, `path:`) across the whole history, `V` ranges with a combined diff,
  and `b` to compare HEAD with any branch.
- Opening files in `$EDITOR` at a line and diffs in a configurable difftool.
- A remappable keymap, 11 built-in themes plus user themes, and a TOML config.
- Automatic tuning of large repositories (commit-graph, untracked cache, fsmonitor where git
  supports it), reverted exactly by `gitty untune`.
